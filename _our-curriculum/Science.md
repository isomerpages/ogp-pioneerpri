<h3><strong>Science</strong></h3>
<p>Science education in Pioneer Primary aims to enthuse and nurture all students
to be scientifically literate and they learn to ask, find or determine
answers to questions about everyday experiences. Equipped with strong Science
fundamentals and 21st Century Competencies such as critical and inventive
thinking and effective communication, students will have the essential
skills and knowledge, be prepared for future learning and work. To foster
the joy of learning, students are provided with authentic experiences both
in and out of classroom settings to promote self-directed and collaborative
learning.</p>

<p><strong>Our Key Strategies</strong>
</p>
<p>Through <strong>inquiry-based learning (IBL)</strong>, students familiarise
themselves with thinking routines to promote scientific thinking and communication,
ie <strong>Predict-Observe-Explain (POE)</strong> for hands-on experiments
and <strong>Analyse-Concept-Explain (ACE)</strong> for Science in daily context.
Using these two thinking routines, students acquire basic concepts and
hone process skills like analysing, comparing, interpreting and evaluating
to explain scientific phenomenon around them.</p>

<p><strong><em>Science Recess Play @ i-Xperia: </em></strong>
<br>As part of the Science Outreach Programme, activities are curated to ignite
curiosity in students to learn Science beyond the classroom. Students engage
in simple hands-on activities and experiments conducted during the various
recess sessions in the Science activity room (i-Xperia). These experiences
allow students to hone their process skills and acquire scientific knowledge
through play.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Science Discovery: </em></strong>
<br>Conducted fortnightly, the Science Discovery presentations before morning
assembly introduces students to scientific concepts as applied in real-world
situations. By seeing how scientific concepts can be used to explain everyday
phenomenon, students can develop a greater appreciation for the value of
scientific knowledge and be inspired to be life-long learners.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Environmental Education: </em></strong>
<br>Environment education creates an awareness about the environment and the
challenges it faces. Through this programme, we also aim to equip the students
with knowledge and skills to do their part in the care for environment
using the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse and Recyle) and give them opportunities to
put them into action. This will empower students to take action to protect
the environment and promote sustainable development, leading to a better
quality of life for everyone and a healthier planet.

<p>Under this programme, each student is given access to an online platform,
hosted by Science Centre Singapore, where they can choose to complete Science-based
activities from a given list and earn a badge. Support and guidance are
made available for students during the various recess sessions in i-Xperia.
With the Young Scientist Programme, we hope to:

<p><strong>Primary Science Curriculum</strong>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Guided by the Primary Science syllabus, our inquiry-based lessons, with
hands-on experiments conducted in the Science laboratories, build scientific
thinking and communication in students by equipping them with scientific
knowledge, skills, processes and ethics to enable them to explain daily
scientific phenomenon around them and make informed decisions. Through
their learning experience, we aim to build their 21<sup>st</sup> century
competencies for the future.

<p>A Science enrichment programme for Primary 4 and 5 high ability students
that engages them in scientific investigations involving advanced science
concepts. It aims to engage students in scientific inquiry that will help
them to develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions scientists possess
as well as to gain important 21st century competencies such as critical
and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.
