<h3><strong>Science</strong></h3>
<p>Science education in Pioneer Primary aims to enthuse and nurture all students
to be scientifically literate and they learn to ask, find or determine
answers to questions about everyday experiences. Equipped with strong Science
fundamentals and 21st Century Competencies such as critical and inventive
thinking and effective communication, students will have the essential
skills and knowledge, be prepared for future learning and work. To foster
the joy of learning, students are provided with authentic experiences both
in and out of classroom settings to promote self-directed and collaborative
learning.</p>

<p><strong>Our Key Strategies</strong>
</p>
<p>Through <strong>inquiry-based learning (IBL)</strong>, students develop
a spirit of curiosity as they explore their surroundings using scientific
thinking and communication. We employ thinking routines such as <strong>Predict-Observe-Explain (POE)</strong> for
hands-on investigations and <strong>Claim-Evidence-Reasoning (CER)</strong> for
evidence-based explanations to guide their learning journey. These approaches
deepen students' grasp of scientific concepts whilst nurturing critical
process skills including analysis, comparison, interpretation and evaluation.
By cultivating curiosity and encouraging methodical exploration, students
learn to understand scientific phenomena in meaningful and engaging ways.</p>

<p><strong>Science Recess Play @ i-Xperia:</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the Science Outreach Programme, activities are curated to ignite
curiosity in students to learn Science beyond the classroom. Students engage
in simple hands-on activities and experiments conducted during the various
recess sessions in the Science activity space (i-Xperia). These experiences
allow students to hone their process skills and acquire scientific knowledge
through play.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Science Discovery:</strong>
</p>
<p>Conducted fortnightly, the Science Discovery presentations before morning
assembly introduces students to scientific concepts as applied in real-world
situations. By seeing how scientific concepts can be used to explain everyday
phenomenon, students can develop a greater appreciation for the value of
scientific knowledge and be inspired to be life-long learners.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Environmental Education:</strong>
</p>
<p>Environment education creates an awareness about the environment and the
challenges it faces. Through this programme, we also aim to equip the students
with knowledge and skills to do their part in the care for environment
using the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse and Recyle) and give them opportunities to
put them into action. This will empower students to take action to protect
the environment and promote sustainable development, leading to a better
quality of life for everyone and a healthier planet.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Guided by the Primary Science syllabus, our inquiry-based lessons, with
hands-on experiments conducted in the Science laboratories, build scientific
thinking and communication in students by equipping them with scientific
knowledge, skills, processes and ethics to enable them to explain daily
scientific phenomenon around them and make informed decisions. Through
their learning experience, we aim to build their E21CC for the future.</p>
