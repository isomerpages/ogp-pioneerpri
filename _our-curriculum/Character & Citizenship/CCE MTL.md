<h3><strong>Character &amp; Citizenship Education (Mother Tongue Languages)</strong></h3>
<p>Character &amp; Citizenship Education (Mother Tongue Languages), CCE MTL
forms part of the explicit teaching and learning of moral values. Delivered
by MTL teachers, students learn the values taught through cultural stories,
practices, songs, idioms, and proverbs unique to each Mother Tongue Language.
For students who offer the non-Tamil Indian Languages or are exempted from
taking MTL, CCE lessons are taught in English.</p>
<p>Values are better internalised when students’ daily life experiences are
used as contexts to make the learning more relevant and meaningful. This
helps students to apply the skills, values and attitudes in authentic and
meaningful situations.</p>
<p>At the end of the CCE MTL programme, students would be able to:</p>
