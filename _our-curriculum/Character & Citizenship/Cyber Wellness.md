<h3><strong>Cyber Wellness</strong></h3>
<h4>MOE's Cyber Wellness Curriculum in Schools</h4>
<p>The goal of CW lessons is to equip students with life-long social-emotional
competencies and sound values so that they can navigate safely and respectfully
in cyber space and become responsible users of Information Communications
Technology (ICT).</p>
<p>The four key messages for students are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Embrace ICT yet maintain a balanced lifestyle between the physical and
the cyber world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harness the power of ICT for positive purposes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain a positive presence in cyberspace</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be a safe and responsible user of ICT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lessons are delivered via Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Cyber Wellness Framework</h4>
<p>The CW framework is used to develop the child’s instinct to protect and
empower himself to take responsibility for his own well-being in cyberspace.
The three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible
Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ when adhered to will augur well for
a child’s well-being in cyberspace as he will then be able to make careful
and well-considered decisions.</p>

<h4>Key Principles</h4>
<p>(1) Respect for Self and Others
<br>Students need to:</p>

participate in only legal online activities)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>respect other people online (e.g. put themselves in others’ shoes, accept
diverse views and opinions, give credit when using other people’s work
and seek permission where necessary, avoid sharing hurtful materials).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(2) Safe and Responsible Use
<br>Students need to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>have an understanding of the risks of harmful and illegal online behaviours,
and take steps to protect themselves (e.g. keep their personal information
private, verify the reliability of information using various sources, take
steps to avoid dangers they may encounter online).</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>(3) Positive Peer Influence

<h4>Sense-Think-Act @ Home</h4>
<p>To complement the CW curriculum in school, parents can set a good example
at home in the use of technology and play an active role in guiding our
children to navigate in cyberspace. To ensure that their children are safe
and have positive experiences online, parents can access the following
guides for information:</p>
