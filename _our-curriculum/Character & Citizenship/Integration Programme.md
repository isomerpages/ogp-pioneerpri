<h3><strong>Integration Programme</strong></h3>
<p>Our Integration Programme aims to&nbsp;<strong>assimilate</strong>&nbsp;our
International and/or Permanent Residents students into our local learning
environment and culture through&nbsp;<strong>authentic learning experiences</strong>.
Through&nbsp;<strong>hands-on experience</strong>&nbsp;of traditional games
and&nbsp;<strong>learning journeys</strong>, these students&nbsp;<strong>gain a better understanding</strong>&nbsp;of
the history of Singapore, thus&nbsp;<strong>developing the interest and connection to Singapore</strong>.
Despite Covid19, students continue to learn more about the culture of Singapore
and the places of interest through the use of an&nbsp;<strong>online learning platform â€“ Student Learning Space (SLS)</strong>.</p>
