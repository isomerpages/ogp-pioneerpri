# Character & Citizenship Education (Mother Tongue Languages)

<p align="Justify">Character & Citizenship Education (Mother Tongue Languages), CCE MTL forms part of the explicit teaching and learning of moral values. Delivered by MTL teachers, students learn the values taught through cultural stories, practices, songs, idioms, and proverbs unique to each Mother Tongue Language. For students who offer the non-Tamil Indian Languages or are exempted from taking MTL, CCE lessons are taught in English.</p>

<p align="Justify">Values are better internalised when studentsâ€™ daily life experiences are used as contexts to make the learning more relevant and meaningful. This helps students to apply the skills, values and attitudes in authentic and meaningful situations.  </p>

At the end of the CCE MTL programme, students would be able to:

* put good values into practice
* be responsible in their actions
* cultivate good communication and social skills
* develop good habits as a result of consistently doing what is right and good
