<h1>National Education</h1>
<p>National Education (NE) is part of holistic education. It aims to develop
national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and
boost students’ confidence in our nation's future. It also emphasises on
cultivating a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness to Singapore.</p>
<p>The National Education messages and accompanying values are:</p>

<h4>Our Approach</h4>
<p>Our school observes the 4 commemorative events that are linked to important
points in Singapore’s history. The aim is to entrench these events and
the images they evoke in the consciousness of each successive generation.</p>

<p><strong>Total Defence Day</strong>
<br>
<br>Total Defence Day (TDD) is commemorated annually on 15 February which
marks the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. Our students learn
to reflect on how Total Defence remains our best all-round response to
threats and challenges that confront Singapore (e.g. terrorism, pandemics,
cyber-attacks, influence campaigns, economic crises). They also reflect
on the continuing relevance of the six Total Defence pillars (military,
civil, economic, social, digital and psychological) and the core message
to every Singaporean to stand together, with each playing his part to protect
Singapore and our shared way of life.</p>

<p><strong>International Friendship Day</strong>
<br>
<br>International Friendship Day (IFD) is commemorated on the 3rd Friday of
Term 2 where students learn about and appreciate the diverse and colourful
culture and traditions of the region.&nbsp; Our students get to reflect
the impact and importance of the following to Singapore:
<br>
<br>· An active foreign policy to maintain our international space
<br>· Openness to the international flow of trade, ideas and talent
<br>· Cross-cultural skills and a global orientation
<br>· Mutual respect and understanding to maintain social cohesion in our
multi-cultural society</p>

<p><strong>Racial Harmony Day</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>Racial Harmony Day (RHD) marks the anniversary of the 1964 racial riots.
On 21 July, our school commemorates RHD with our students to celebrate
Singapore as a harmonious society built on a rich diversity of cultures,
requiring collaborative efforts from all to promote social cohesion and
harmony.&nbsp; Students learn that in Singapore, people are treated equally
regardless of race and religion.&nbsp; They will learn to make friends
with people of other races, religions and diverse backgrounds, and appreciate
the multi-cultural mix that makes Singapore unique.</p>

<p><strong>National Day</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>National Day marks our separation from Malaysia in 1965, and our emergence
as an independent country in a community of nations. Since 1998, schools
have commemorated National Day for students to reflect on the historical
importance and solemnity of National Day.
<br>
<br><strong>NE Show</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since 1997, all Primary 5 students are invited to attend the NE Show,
which is essentially a preview of the National Day Parade to better appreciate
the significance of National Day.</p>
