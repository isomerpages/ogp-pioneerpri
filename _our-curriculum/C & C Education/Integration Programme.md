# Integration Programme

<p align="Justify">Our Integration Programme aims to <b>assimilate</b> our International and/or Permanent Residents students into our local learning environment and culture through <b>authentic learning experiences</b>. Through <b>hands-on experience</b> of traditional games and <b>learning journeys</b>, these students <b>gain a better understanding</b> of the history of Singapore, thus <b>developing the interest and connection to Singapore</b>. Despite Covid19, students continue to learn more about the culture of Singapore and the places of interest through the use of an <b>online learning platform â€“ Student Learning Space (SLS)</b>.</p>
