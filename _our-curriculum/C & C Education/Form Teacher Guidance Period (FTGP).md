<h3>Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)</h3>
<p>Form Teachers play a central role in shaping the development of their
young charges. They use Form Teacher Guidance Period to bond with their
students through interaction activities and build positive Teacher-Student
Relationship (TSR).</p>
<h4>Learning Outcomes</h4>
<p>FTGP lessons with purposeful teacher-student interactions and the explicit
teaching of social and emotional competencies are planned. This is to provide
the platform for teachers and students to establish good rapport and to
allow teachers to identify the needs of students to provide them with better
support.</p>
<h4>Our Key Approaches / Strategies</h4>
<p>During FTGP lessons, there could be play activities between the form teacher
and students to enhance bonding as well as the teaching of social and emotional
competencies for the following outcomes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>better understand themselves (Self-Awareness);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learn ways to manage themselves (Self-Management);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>better understand their family and friends (Social Awareness);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learn ways to relate with their family and friends (Relationship Management)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make appropriate and responsible decisions (Responsible Decision Making)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Our Key Programmes (Customised)</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1-1 CHAT &amp; GROW</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Form Teachers conduct one-on-one CHAT &amp; GROW sessions with the students
they mentor. This initiative provides meaningful opportunities for personalised
teacher-student interaction. Through these conversations, teachers can
better understand their students and show genuine care and interest in
their goals for the year. These sessions also help to build mutual respect
and trust, creating a supportive environment where students feel valued
and encouraged.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>GEM@PPS</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>GEM@PPS reinforces the values of gratitude and empathy by providing students
with meaningful opportunities to express appreciation each term. These
moments are intentionally designed and aligned with school programmes and
National Education commemorative events, encouraging students to reflect
on and give thanks for the people, experiences and environment that shape
their lives in Singapore. Through GEM@PPS, students learn to show gratitude
towards themselves, their peers, the school community and the nation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>School-wide VIA (growMe)</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As part of the school's VIA efforts, students grow vegetables in class
using the Indoor Green hydroponic system. This hands-on experience allows
them to put the values of care and responsibility into action as they nurture
the plants daily. Beyond the classroom, students have shared their harvest
by bringing vegetables home, gifting them to non-teaching staff as a gesture
of gratitude, and donating to the Food from the Heart Community Shop@Boon
Lay to support families within the community.</p>
