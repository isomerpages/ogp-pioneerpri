<h3><strong>Character and Citizenship Education</strong></h3>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) plays a vital part in our students’
holistic development, equipping them with the values, social-emotional
skills, and civic consciousness they need to thrive in an increasingly
complex world. Pioneer Primary’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)
Curriculum takes reference from MOE’s CCE 2021 Curriculum Framework (see
Figure 1). The school-based programming also considers the school’s Vision,
Mission and Core Values. Our CCE programmes aim to nurture our students
to become confident and resilient individuals who act with integrity and
graciousness in their dealings with others. These programmes help shape
our students into individuals who not only strive for personal excellence,
but who also care for others and contribute meaningfully to society. By
nurturing good character and a strong sense of identity and belonging,
CCE lays the foundation for students to grow into confident, moral, and
active citizens of Singapore.</p>

<p>Abundant learning opportunities are curated and integrated in the school’s
academic, non-academic and school-based CCE programmes. We provide a series
of customised student-centric and values education programmes so as to
equip students with the essential skills, knowledge and dispositions to
manage self and relationships. Different experiential learning platforms
and opportunities are also made available to enable students apply their
learning in practice and strengthen their socio-emotional competencies.</p>
<h4>Our Approaches</h4>
<p>The curriculum content of CCE is based on the three big ideas of Identity,
Relationships and Choices, and focused on developing a sense of purpose
in our students. CCE programmes are curated centering on the principles
of the 3Hs - Educating the Heads, Engaging the Hearts and Empowering the
Hands. The six CCE domains - Self, Family, School, Community, Nation and
Global also play an integral role in the planning and coordination of all
CCE programmes.</p>
<h4>Enactment of CCE</h4>
<p>We adopt a whole school approach to broaden and deepen students’ experiences
in character and citizenship education. There are several learning platforms
where CCE is enacted with intentionality. These include CCE lessons during
curriculum time, key student development experiences beyond the classroom,
school-based initiatives and teachable moments during subject lessons and
learning opportunities beyond the school.</p>
<p><strong><em>CCE Lessons</em></strong>
<br>These lessons provide the time and space for relationship building between
teachers and students. Through in-depth discussions and effective facilitation,
students get the opportunities to acquire skills and knowledge, analyse
issues and evaluate case studies using a critical and empathetic lens.</p>
<p>Broadly, there are three ways CCE lesson time is used:</p>

<p><strong><em>Sense Making Through CCE Experiences</em></strong>
<br>Sense making is important for CCE learning to become meaningful for students.
Through authentic learning opportunities both within and beyond school,
students develop the habit of self-reflection and gratitude. CCE provides
the skills and knowledge to help students make sense of their life experiences
and the language to express their learning and development.</p>
