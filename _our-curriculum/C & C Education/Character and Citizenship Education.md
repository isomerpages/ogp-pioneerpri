# Character and Citizenship Education

<p align="Justify">Pioneer Primary’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Curriculum takes reference from MOE’s CCE 2021 Curriculum Framework (see Figure 1). The school-based programming also considers the school’s Vision, Mission and Core Values. Our CCE programmes aim to nurture our students to become confident and resilient individuals who act with integrity and graciousness in their dealings with others.</p>

<p align="Justify">Abundant learning opportunities are curated and integrated in the school’s academic, non-academic and school-based CCE programmes. We provide a series of customised student-centric and values education programmes so as to equip students with the essential skills, knowledge and dispositions to manage self and relationships. Different experiential learning platforms and opportunities are also made available to enable students apply their learning in practice and strengthen their socio-emotional competencies.</p>


## Our Approaches

<p align="Justify">The curriculum content of CCE is based on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices, and focused on developing a sense of purpose in our students. CCE programmes are curated centering on the principles of the 3Hs - Educating the Heads, Engaging the Hearts and Empowering the Hands. The six CCE domains - Self, Family, School, Community, Nation and Global also play an integral role in the planning and coordination of all CCE programmes. </p>

#### Enactment of CCE

<p align="Justify">We adopt a whole school approach to broaden and deepen students’ experiences in character and citizenship education. There are several learning platforms where CCE is enacted with intentionality. These include CCE lessons during curriculum time, key student development experiences beyond the classroom, school-based initiatives and teachable moments during subject lessons and learning opportunities beyond the school.</p>



<p align="Justify"> <b><i>CCE Lessons</i></b><br>These lessons provide the time and space for relationship building between teachers and students. Through in-depth discussions and effective facilitation, students get the opportunities to acquire skills and knowledge, analyse issues and evaluate case studies using a critical and empathetic lens.</p>

 

Broadly, there are three ways CCE lesson time is used:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Explicit Teaching</td>
<td>
<div align="Justify">Focus on the holistic learning and developmental needs of students through explicit teaching of values and social and emotional skills, knowledge and competencies via platforms including Form Teacher Guidance Programme (FTGP), CCE (Mother Tongue) and Sexuality Education.</div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Contextualised Learning</td>
<td>
<div align="Justify">Emphasise the importance of understanding real world contexts and development through National Education, Cyber-Wellness Programme, and Education and Career Guidance.</div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Relating to the World</td>
<td>
<div align="Justify">Generate awareness about current realities by discussing contemporary issues related to national, regional and/or global contexts. Through platforms like National Education programmes and Values in Action, teachers facilitate discussion and critical thinking, and encourage student voices which help them to develop the 21CC related to citizenship.</div>
</td>

<p align="Justify"><b><i>Sense Making Through CCE Experiences</i></b><br>Sense making is important for CCE learning to become meaningful for students. Through authentic learning opportunities both within and beyond school, students develop the habit of self-reflection and gratitude. CCE provides the skills and knowledge to help students make sense of their life experiences, and the language to express their learning and development.</p>

#### Providing a Caring and Enabling School Environment

<p align="Justify">We place great emphasis on providing our students with a nurturing and caring school environment that promotes a growth mindset and sense of belonging. We intentionally create platforms to allow students to experience competence, exercise autonomy and build strong relationships with others, and feel psychologically and emotionally safe. Our programmes are designed with the following features to meet student needs:</p>


* Consistent and Coherent Messaging – Eg. Morning/Level assemblies with School Values
