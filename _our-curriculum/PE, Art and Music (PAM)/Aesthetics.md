<h3><strong>The Art Curriculum</strong></h3>
<p>Our Art curriculum offers every student the opportunity to experience
the joy of artistic expression, communicate ideas visually and forge meaningful
connections with diverse art forms and cultures. Aligned with the goals
of 21st Century Competencies (21CC), the programme spans Primary 1 to 6,
nurturing students' creativity, critical thinking, collaboration and communication
skills. Through varied artistic experiences, students learn to express
themselves creatively, analyse visual messages critically and work collaboratively
to create meaningful artwork.</p>
<p>The curriculum emphasises the study of local artwork and artists, deepening
students' understanding of our national identity and cultural heritage.
Art discussions enhance visual literacy and articulate expression, whilst
the creative process cultivates imagination and innovation—essential qualities
for navigating future challenges. Our Art programme supports holistic development
by engaging both mind and heart, empowering students to become confident
and connected learners.</p>

<h3><strong>The Music Curriculum</strong></h3>
<p>Our music education philosophy rests on the conviction that every child
possesses inherent musicality and unique talents. These natural abilities—including
listening, singing, playing, creating and expressing—flourish through meaningful
and engaging learning experiences. We strive to nurture students' aural
and expressive capabilities, empowering them to become active participants
in music appreciation and creation.</p>
<p>The comprehensive Primary 1 to 6 music curriculum exposes students to
diverse musical genres and styles, enabling them to connect with their
cultural heritage whilst developing appreciation for both Singapore's musical
traditions and global musical diversity. Beyond developing musicality,
the curriculum supports holistic growth by cultivating values, character
and social-emotional well-being. It also develops essential 21st Century
Competencies (21CC) such as creativity, communication and collaboration,
whilst enhancing psychomotor abilities and fostering skills that transcend
the music classroom.</p>
