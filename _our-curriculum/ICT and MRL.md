# ICT and MRL

Today almost every child grows up with digital devices at home and in the classroom, and this changes the way he/she learns.  To ensure Pioneer students are equipped with the digital know-how and become self-directed and responsible users of digital technology, the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) department designs relevant learning programmes incorporated with skills, knowledge, attitude and values that will enable them to apply and demonstrate when they

* Curate digital content,
* Create digital multimodal products, and 
* Connect and communicate digitally across a range of digital media platforms in the digital networked environment. 

Adopting MOE’s New Media Literacies Framework, Pioneer ICT learning programmes also covers cyber security and wellness in the critical areas and issues associated with ethical and legal as well as safe and responsible use of ICT.
