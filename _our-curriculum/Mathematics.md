<h1>Mathematics</h1>
<p>At Pioneer Primary School, we believe that every student possesses the
potential and ability to learn and thrive in Mathematics. Our teaching
approach is anchored in mathematical problem-solving and is designed to
strengthen the five key components of the Mathematics Framework, in alignment
with the MOE National curriculum. Beyond just learning about mathematical
concepts, we aim to immerse our students in the world of Mathematicsâ€”encouraging
them to think, reason, and approach challenges like mathematicians. By
doing so, students not only develop strong mathematical skills but also
experience the joy of learning Mathematics as a meaningful and empowering
part of their daily lives.</p>
