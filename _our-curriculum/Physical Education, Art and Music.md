# Physical Education, Art and Music

Physical Education, Art and Music (PAM) aim to develop students holistically across all domains - Moral, Cognitive, Physical, Social and Aesthetics.  PAM education in Pioneer aims to enable our students to develop physical well-being and enhance their creative and expressive capabilities.

**Physical Education Curriculum**
The Physical Education (PE) Curriculum is designed to equip our students with a strong foundation in fundamental movement skills and core values for the learning, participation and enjoyment of a wide variety of sports and physical activities.  Our students are encouraged to participate in self-directed regular exercises which can be done individually and with others.  With regular practice of such physical skills, students learn to value the importance of leading a lifetime of active and healthy living.  
 
We make use of movement as the primary medium to reach and teach the whole child through the following three modes:
 
* Education in movement
* Education through movement; and
* Education about movement

**Art Curriculum**

“Art can connect people more deeply to the world and open them to new ways of seeing.” The Pioneer Art Curriculum provides the foundation for all students to understand art as a way of learning about themselves and the world around them.  Involvement in the arts is associated with gains in math, reading, cognitive ability, critical thinking and verbal skills.  It can also improve motivation, concentration, confidence and teamwork.

As an academic subject in the school curriculum, art is integral to the holistic development of every student, with much emphasis in the aesthetic, cognitive and affective dimensions. Pioneer Art Curriculum is carefully designed to allow students to **enjoy art, communicate visually, and make meaning through connecting with society and culture**. Students are presented with ample opportunities for creative and innovative self-expression in varied modes and in accordance to their interests and talents. The learning of local artworks and artists strengthens the understanding of the individual’s national identity by fostering the appreciation of one’s cultural heritage. The engagement in art discussions promotes a lifelong enjoyment and an appreciation for artistic works; develop visual literacy in our students. The production of artwork encourages imagination and cultivates in students the capacity to innovate and improvise.
