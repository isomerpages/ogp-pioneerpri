# Physical Education, Art and Music

<P align="justify">Physical Education, Art and Music (PAM) aim to develop students holistically across all domains - Moral, Cognitive, Physical, Social and Aesthetics.  PAM education in Pioneer aims to enable our students to develop physical well-being and enhance their creative and expressive capabilities.</P>

### Physical Education Curriculum

<P align="justify">The Physical Education (PE) Curriculum is designed to equip our students with a strong foundation in fundamental movement skills and core values for the learning, participation and enjoyment of a wide variety of sports and physical activities.&nbsp; Our students are encouraged to participate in self-directed regular exercises which can be done individually and with others.&nbsp; With regular practice of such physical skills, students learn to value the importance of leading a lifetime of active and healthy living.</P>

We make use of movement as the primary medium to reach and teach the whole child through the following three modes:

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Education _in_ movement<br>
●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Education _through_ movement; and<br>
●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Education _about_ movement

### Art Curriculum

<P align="justify">“Art can connect people more deeply to the world and open them to new ways of seeing.” The Pioneer Art Curriculum provides the foundation for all students to understand art as a way of learning about themselves and the world around them. Involvement in the arts is associated with gains in math, reading, cognitive ability, critical thinking and verbal skills. It can also improve motivation, concentration, confidence and teamwork.</P>

<P align="justify">“As an academic subject in the school curriculum, art is integral to the holistic development of every student, with much emphasis in the aesthetic, cognitive and affective dimensions.&nbsp; Pioneer Art Curriculum is carefully designed to allow students to <b>enjoy art, communicate visually, and make meaning through connecting with society and culture.</b>&nbsp; Students are presented with ample opportunities for creative and innovative self-expression in varied modes and in accordance to their interests and talents. The learning of local artworks and artists strengthens the understanding of the individual’s national identity by fostering the appreciation of one’s cultural heritage. The engagement in art discussions promotes a lifelong enjoyment and an appreciation for artistic works; develop visual literacy in our students. The production of artwork encourages imagination and cultivates in students the capacity to innovate and improvise.</P>

### Music Curriculum

<P align="justify">In Pioneer Primary, we create our own spiral music curriculum which is aligned to MOE’s syllabus’ aim of:</P>

a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquire and apply musical skills, knowledge and understanding through listening, creating and performing <br>
b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop abilities for creative expression and communication<br>
c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop an understanding and appreciation of music in local and global cultures<br>
d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultivate a life-long enjoyment and involvement in music.

<P align="justify">We believed that musical experiences enhance our lives and enrich our understanding of ourselves and the world. At the individual level, music is a medium of self-expression. It enables the sharing of feelings, ideas and experiences. It has the capacity to cross cultural and social boundaries; and builds our understanding of cultures through time. At the community and societal level, music plays important roles in strengthening cultural identities, fostering social cohesion, and forming national identity. Music education therefore contributes to the appreciation, preservation and renewal of Singapore’s cultural heritage and traditions.</P>
