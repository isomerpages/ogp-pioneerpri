<h3><strong>Mother Tongue Languages</strong></h3>
<p>At Pioneer Primary School, the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department
is deeply committed to develop students into passionate and confident communicators
who not only master their MTL but also develop a meaningful connection
to their cultural heritage. Through a wide range of engaging pedagogies,
innovative teaching strategies, and authentic learning experiences, we
bring the language to life for our students, helping them see its value
in everyday situations and future contexts.</p>
<p>Our P1 to P6 curriculum and school-based programmes, including various
vibrant cultural celebrations immerse students in rich traditions and heritage,
deepening their understanding and appreciation of their own culture. These
experiences are crafted to spark curiosity and encourage students to embrace
their MTL with enthusiasm and strive for excellence in its use.</p>
<p>Guided by our MTL Curriculum Framework, which focuses on four key areas,
our dedicated teachers are equipped to create impactful learning journeys
that inspire students to connect, communicate, and grow with confidence
in their Mother Tongue.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching of Chinese Language</strong>
</p>
<p>In the teaching of the Chinese Language (CL), we adopt a thematic-based
approach to foster our students’ interest in the language and build their
confidence and motivation to learn the language from young.</p>
<p>To make language learning enjoyable for students, various strategies including
storytelling, hands-on activities and role-play are used to make the learning
process fun, memorable and meaningful.</p>
<p>We strive to develop students’ linguistic skills in CL, in terms of listening,
speaking, reading and writing in a structured manner. Students are guided
to achieve progressive learning outcomes throughout their 6 years of primary
education with Pioneer. These outcomes are shared with parents and students
through formative and summative assessments, and daily lessons.</p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p>In line with MOE’s syllabus, the teaching and learning of CL is conducted
via the modular approach that caters to the different learning needs of
our students.</p>
<p>All students take Core Modules throughout Primary 1 to Primary 6. At Lower
Primary, Bridging Modules serve as a form of additional support for students
who have little exposure to CL prior to entering primary school. These
modules focus on building students’ listening and speaking skills and competencies,
giving them more confidence in the learning of CL and helping them to cope
well with the CL Curriculum. At Middle Primary, students who need additional
support will be introduced the Reinforcement Modules. To give further support,
we introduced the Mother Tongue Support Programme (MTSP), an in-house programme
specially designed for Middle Primary students who need extra guidance
and support. Students who demonstrate strong ability and interest for CL
are offered Enrichment Modules at Upper Primary where they get the opportunity
to hone and strengthen their language skills.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching of Malay Language</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/OurCurriculum/image4.jpg">
</div>
<p>In line with MOE’s Malay Language vision of ‘Arif Budiman’, at the end
of the 6-year primary education in Pioneer, our students will be active
and proficient in the use of Malay Language (ML) and develop deep appreciation
of its culture as part of the multi-racial community in Singapore.&nbsp;
The learning process is carefully designed to equip students with essential
knowledge and skills that will make them become competent users of ML.</p>
<p>The ML syllabus focuses on listening, speaking, reading and writing.&nbsp;
These skills are explicitly taught so that students are able to communicate
and interact effectively and with confidence.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/OurCurriculum/image5.png">
</div>
<p>We adopt a student-centred approach which focuses on teaching of language
in an interactive manner. &nbsp;Students are actively involved in the learning
process where they learn to read critically, think creatively and collaborate
closely with their classmates. Teachers adopt Differentiated Instruction
to better cater to students with different learning profiles and abilities,
and build students’ competency and understanding of the language.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching of Tamil Language</strong>
</p>
<p>We aim to nurture students’ love for Tamil Language (TL) through interesting
learning experiences that are delivered in a joyful and stimulating learning
environment.&nbsp; Various programmes and learning activities are put in
place to develop students’ language proficiency and deepen their passion
for the language.</p>
