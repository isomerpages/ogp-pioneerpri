<h3><strong><u>The Art Curriculum</u></strong></h3>
<p>Our Art curriculum offers every student the opportunity to experience
the joy of artistic expression, communicate ideas visually and forge meaningful
connections with diverse art forms and cultures. Aligned with the goals
of 21st Century Competencies (21CC), the programme spans Primary 1 to 6,
nurturing students' creativity, critical thinking, collaboration and communication
skills. Through varied artistic experiences, students learn to express
themselves creatively, analyse visual messages critically and work collaboratively
to create meaningful artwork.</p>
<p>The curriculum emphasises the study of local artwork and artists, deepening
students' understanding of our national identity and cultural heritage.
Art discussions enhance visual literacy and articulate expression, whilst
the creative process cultivates imagination and innovationâ€”essential qualities
for navigating future challenges. Our Art programme supports holistic development
by engaging both mind and heart, empowering students to become confident
and connected learners.</p>
