<h3><strong>Programme for Active Learning (PAL)</strong></h3>
<p>Rapid technological advancements, changing social contexts, global conflicts
and economic disruptions are some of the key driving forces of our current
times, and they will continue to shape our future, bringing about new norms
and challenges. We need to equip our students with the <strong>21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Century Competencies and nurture dispositions</strong> to
adapt and face these challenges, as well as to <strong>seize new and exciting opportunities</strong> brought
forth by these changes.​</p>
<p>Our school is committed to nurturing 21st Century Competencies (21CC)
in our students from their early years. To achieve this, all Primary 1
and 2 students will go through Programme for Active Learning (PAL) which
is an MOE initiative that emphasises non-academic development through hands-on,
engaging activities. The school has thoughtfully designed a diverse range
of PAL activities that provide students with opportunities to develop <strong>a sense of competence and confidence</strong> as
well <strong>as social skills</strong>. Our students will be able to use
the <strong>acquired skills, transfer their learning, and thrive </strong>across
different contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Objective </strong>of PAL is to :</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
