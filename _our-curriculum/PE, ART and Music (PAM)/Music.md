<h3><strong><u>The Music Curriculum</u></strong></h3>
<p>Our music education philosophy rests on the conviction that every child
possesses inherent musicality and unique talents. These natural abilities—including
listening, singing, playing, creating and expressing—flourish through meaningful
and engaging learning experiences. We strive to nurture students' aural
and expressive capabilities, empowering them to become active participants
in music appreciation and creation.</p>
<p>The comprehensive Primary 1 to 6 music curriculum exposes students to
diverse musical genres and styles, enabling them to connect with their
cultural heritage whilst developing appreciation for both Singapore's musical
traditions and global musical diversity. Beyond developing musicality,
the curriculum supports holistic growth by cultivating values, character
and social-emotional well-being. It also develops essential 21st Century
Competencies (21CC) such as creativity, communication and collaboration,
whilst enhancing psychomotor abilities and fostering skills that transcend
the music classroom.</p>
