<h3><u>The Physical Education Curriculum</u></h3>
<p>Our PE curriculum establishes a strong foundation in fundamental movement
skills whilst instilling core values that promote an active and healthy
lifestyle. We encourage students to maintain physical activity through
self-directed pursuits, developing positive habits that endure throughout
their lives. The Primary 1 to 6 curriculum emphasises education in, through
and about movement, ensuring holistic and purposeful learning.</p>
<p>Through dynamic lessons and team activities, students develop effective
collaboration skills, problem-solving abilities and mutual support. They
build resilience and disciplineâ€”essential life skills that extend beyond
sports. Our aim is to empower every student to embrace an active, healthy
lifestyle whilst experiencing the physical, social and emotional benefits
of movement.</p>
