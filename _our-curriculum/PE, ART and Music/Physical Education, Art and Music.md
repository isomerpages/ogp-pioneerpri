<h1>About PAM</h1>
<p>Physical Education, Art and Music (PAM) are essential in developing the
whole child—morally, cognitively, physically, socially and aesthetically.
Our PAM curriculum nurtures students' physical well-being and creative
expression whilst building character, confidence and a strong sense of
personal, cultural and social identity. Through this approach, we deliberately
cultivate 21st Century Competencies (21CC) such as creativity, critical
thinking, communication and collaboration—capabilities vital for success
in today's dynamic world.</p>
