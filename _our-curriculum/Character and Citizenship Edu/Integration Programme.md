# Integration Programme

Our Integration Programme aims to **assimilate** our International and/or Permanent Residents students into our local learning environment and culture through **authentic learning experiences**. Through **hands-on experience** of traditional games and **learning journeys**, these students **gain a better understanding** of the history of Singapore, thus **developing the interest and connection to Singapore**. Despite Covid19, students continue to learn more about the culture of Singapore and the places of interest through the use of an **online learning platform â€“ Student Learning Space (SLS)**.
