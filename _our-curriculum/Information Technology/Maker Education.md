<h4>Maker Education</h4>
<p>Maker Education is an innovative, student-centred approach that promotes
experiential learning and cultivates curiosity and creativity. Through
hands-on experiences, our students learn to empathise, design, prototype,
and create solutions for real-world problems; strengthening their competencies
in Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking, and Communication.</p>
<p>Our maker programmes are strategically designed with the following learning
approaches:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Play-based Creation – Students explore making with physical materials
and tools, discover the joy of crafting and building, and develop practical
skills and spatial thinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenge-based Creation – Students develop critical, adaptive and inventive
thinking when generating and testing solutions in the context of a challenge
with presence of constraints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User-centric Solutioning – Students nurture empathy as they understand
the needs and feel the pain points of users when generating solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these approaches, our students develop into confident creators
and innovative problem-solvers who can effectively translate ideas into
meaningful solutions.</p>
