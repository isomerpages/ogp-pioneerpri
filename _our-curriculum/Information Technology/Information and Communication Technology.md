<h1>Information &amp; Communication Technology</h1>
<p>We recognise the importance of digital and technological competency as
a pivot to our students' success in an increasingly fast-paced and connected
world. In school, we are dedicated to equipping our students the essential
digital competencies stated below that will empower them to navigate, contribute,
and thrive confidently in the digital age.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Digital Literacy and Technological Skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digital Safety, Security and Responsibility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computational Thinking, Coding and Programming</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These competencies prepare our students to become confident, critical
and responsible users of technology in an increasingly digital world.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Digital Literacy and Technological Skills</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Digital Knowledge Currency – Students embrace lifelong learning and stay
up-to-date with technological developments and digital resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Device and Software Operations – Students gain practical understanding
of how devices and software work in order to use them productively and
effectively</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digital Information Management – Students use strategies and apply critical
thinking to locate, evaluate, and manage digital information effectively</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Competencies – Students develop skills and apply analytical capacity
to read, understand, interpret, manipulate and present data meaningfully</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digital Communication, Collaboration and Participation – Students learn
to leverage digital platforms to share ideas, connect with others, and
contribute constructively to group goals</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through meaningful integration of technology across subjects, we empower
our students to harness technology confidently, creatively and responsibly
in their learning.</p>
<h4>Digital Safety, Security and Responsibility</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Digital Safety and Security – Students develop understanding of online
behaviour and awareness of risks in the cyber space, and learn to protect
themselves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digital Responsibility – Students demonstrate respect for themselves and
others online, and practise safe, responsible, and ethical use of technology</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of our programmes and activities are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Cyber-Wellness Lesson (FTGP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engagement and Commemoration (Recess Activity)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coaching and Mentoring (Intervention for At-Risk Students)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Computational Thinking, Coding and Programming</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Computational Thinking – Students employ computational thinking (Pattern
Recognition, Decomposition, Algorithm, and Abstraction) together with technological
tools to solve problems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coding and Programming – Students utilise block-based programming and
prompt engineering to create digital artefacts and innovative solutions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of our programmes and activities are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Primary 1 and 2 Genius Hour</p>

<p>Our comprehensive programmes equip our students with essential competencies,
literacy and skills; nurturing them to become digitally-empowered, future-ready
learners and innovators who can thrive in tomorrow's digital landscape.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Maker Education</h4>
<p>Maker Education is an innovative, student-centred approach that promotes
experiential learning and cultivates curiosity and creativity. Through
hands-on experiences, our students learn to empathise, design, prototype,
and create solutions for real-world problems; strengthening their competencies
in Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking, and Communication.</p>
<p>Our maker programmes are strategically designed with the following learning
approaches:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Play-based Creation – Students explore making with physical materials
and tools, discover the joy of crafting and building, and develop practical
skills and spatial thinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenge-based Creation – Students develop critical, adaptive and inventive
thinking when generating and testing solutions in the context of a challenge
with presence of constraints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User-centric Solutioning – Students nurture empathy as they understand
the needs and feel the pain points of users when generating solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these approaches, our students develop into confident creators
and innovative problem-solvers who can effectively translate ideas into
meaningful solutions.</p>
<p>Some of our programmes and activities are:</p>
