<h3>Teaching of Chinese Language</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In the teaching of the Chinese Language (CL), we adopt a thematic-based
approach to foster our students’ interest in the language and build their
confidence and motivation to learn the language from young.</p>
<p>To make language learning enjoyable for students, various strategies including
storytelling, hands-on activities and role-play are used to make the learning
process fun, memorable and meaningful.</p>
<p>We strive to develop students’ linguistic skills in CL, in terms of listening,
speaking, reading and writing in a structured manner. Students are guided
to achieve progressive learning outcomes throughout their 6 years of primary
education with Pioneer.&nbsp; These outcomes are shared with parents and
students through formative and summative assessments, and daily lessons.</p>

<p>In line with MOE’s syllabus, the teaching and learning of CL is conducted
via the modular approach that caters to the different learning needs of
our students.</p>
<p>All students take Core Modules throughout Primary 1 to Primary 6.&nbsp;
At Lower Primary, Bridging Modules serve as a form of additional support
for students who have little exposure to CL prior to entering primary school.&nbsp;
These modules focus on building students’ listening and speaking skills
and competencies, giving them more confidence in the learning of CL and
helping them to cope well with the CL Curriculum.&nbsp;&nbsp; At Middle
Primary, students who need additional support will be introduced the Reinforcement
Modules.&nbsp; To give further support, we introduced the Mother Tongue
Support Programme (MTSP), an in-house programme specially designed for
Middle Primary students who need extra guidance and support.&nbsp; Students
who demonstrate strong ability and interest for CL are offered Enrichment
Modules at Upper Primary where they get the opportunity to hone and strengthen
their language skills.</p>
