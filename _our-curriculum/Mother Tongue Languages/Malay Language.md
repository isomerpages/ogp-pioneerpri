<h3>Teaching of Malay Language</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In line with MOE Malay Language vision of ‘Arif Budiman’, at the end of
primary school, we hope that the pupils will be able to build their knowledge,
language proficiency and positive traits at primary school before they
embark to secondary and higher learning institution. We hope that the pupils
are not only knowledgeable but able to contribute positively to society.</p>
<p>Our ML department uses student-centered approach which focuses on teaching
Malay Language in an interactive manner. &nbsp;With active pupils’ involvement,
learning Malay Language will be a fun and memorable experience.&nbsp; This
will help pupils to be active and competent users of the language.</p>
<p>Differentiated learning caters to pupils with different learning profile
and ability.&nbsp; This gradually builds pupils’ competency and understanding
in the language. Explicit teaching of Malay Language will help pupils to
improve on their mastery of the language.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The ML syllabus focuses on listening, speaking, reading, writing, and
written interaction as well as oral interaction skills.&nbsp; These skills
are taught so that pupils are able to communicate and interact effectively
and with confidence.</p>
