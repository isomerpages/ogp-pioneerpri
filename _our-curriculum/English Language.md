# English Language

Pioneer Primary School uses both Stellar (the national English Language curriculum) and our school-based curriculum to achieve the outcomes specified by MOE's English Language Syllabus.

The English Language Syllabus focuses on the development, reinforcement and extension of language skills in the primary years through an enjoyment of the language and the promotion of extensive reading; and leveraging oracy, reading and writing skills to develop knowledge and independent use of the language.

| Speech & Drama Programme (Primary 1 & 2)                      | Confidence and attitude play an important role in public speaking. In order to hone confident speakers, we have integrated Speech and Drama into the English Curriculum. Through this programme, our students learn the necessary building blocks of effective communication.  The Speech and Drama Programme is conducted once weekly. At the end of the semester, students put up a performance for their parents to showcase their talents and the skills they have acquired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |   |

| Little Red Dot (Selected P4 classes, P5 & P6)                 | Little Red Dot is a supplementary reading resource for P4 (selected classes) to P6 students. Students read about current affairs and engage in meaningful conversations with one another about these issues. Critical thinking is developed during the rich class discussions through the use of Thinking Routines e.g. Colour-Symbol-Image (CSI).   Once a week, selected students are given the platform to share what they have read and their reflections to the whole school. This gives them the opportunity to develop their public speaking skills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |   |
| Books Alive!                                                  | Books Alive! is an annual event to celebrate the joy of reading and to inspire one another to read. From Harry Potter to Cat in the Hat , Where’s Wally to Pinochio, on Books Alive! day, students and teachers come to school dressed as their favourite fictional characters to celebrate their love for reading.  In preparation for the big day, they design and create their very own one-of-a-kind costumes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |   |
| Literature (English) Appreciation Programme (LEAP) for P3 & 4 | LEAP aims to develop in students speaking, writing and critical thinking skills. In this programme, students are introduced to popular and engaging literature texts.  Once a week, students explore the different literary elements and are engaged in in-depth discussions on themes and issues found in these literature texts  During the literature lessons, teachers use Paul’s Wheel of Reasoning, a critical thinking tool, to help students make inferences, recognise different points of view, and engage in other forms of logical reasoning as they work through the texts. At the end of the two-year programme, students emerge as critical thinkers, empathetic listeners, confident communicators and proficient writers.                                                                                      |   |
