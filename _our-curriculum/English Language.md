# English Language

Welcome to our school's English curriculum page! Here at Pioneer Primary School, we believe that a strong foundation in English is key to success in many areas of life. Our English curriculum is designed to supplement the national curriculum (STELLAR Curriculum) and provide our students with a well-rounded education that will prepare them for the future.

<p>Little Red Dot is a supplementary reading resource for P4 (selected classes) to P6 students. Students read about current affairs and engage in meaningful conversations with one another about these issues.</p>
<p>Critical thinking is developed during the rich class discussions through the use of various thinking tools e.g. Thinking Routines and Paul&rsquo;s Wheel of Reasoning. </p>
<p>Once a week, selected students are given the platform to share what they have read and their reflections with the whole school. This gives them the opportunity to develop their public speaking skills.</p>
