# English Language

Pioneer Primary School uses both Stellar (the national English Language curriculum) and our school-based curriculum to achieve the outcomes specified by MOE's English Language Syllabus.

The English Language Syllabus focuses on the development, reinforcement and extension of language skills in the primary years through an enjoyment of the language and the promotion of extensive reading; and leveraging oracy, reading and writing skills to develop knowledge and independent use of the language.
