<h3><strong>Programmes from the English Department</strong></h3>
<p>We enrich the national STELLAR curriculum with our English programmes
that bring language learning to life. We believe every child can be a confident,
engaging, and effective communicator. Through a variety of thoughtfully
designed programmes tailored to different stages of language development,
we spark the joy in learning and nurture a lasting love for the English
language. Our students are empowered with the communication skills they
need to thrive in the 21st century.</p>

<p><strong>🌟 Primary 1 &amp; 2: Speech and Drama Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Our budding learners discover the joy of language through expressive storytelling,
movement, and role-play. The Speech and Drama Programme is designed to
build their confidence, enhance their speaking and listening skills, and
promote joyful learning through drama performances that spark imagination
and creativity. The weekly drama lessons will lead to a captivating end-of-term
performance where students shine on stage with confidence and flair.</p>
<p><strong>🎤 Primary 3 &amp; 4: Young Enthusiasts</strong>
</p>
<p>At P3 &amp; P4 students become young presenters who explore and share
topics they are passionate about. The Young Enthusiasts programme encourages
them to experiment with authentic modes of communication—be it through
visuals, multimedia, or storytelling—to engage their audience meaningfully
and build their confidence in public speaking.</p>
<p><strong>📰 Primary 5: Young Journalists</strong>
</p>
<p>As Young Journalists, our Primary 5 students step into the shoes of news
anchors and reporters. They research and present current events to their
peers during morning assemblies, honing their critical thinking, oral communication,
and presentation skills. The experience also fosters media literacy and
awareness of the world around them.</p>
<p><strong>⚖️ Primary 6: Young Advocates</strong>
</p>
<p>Our graduating cohort takes on the challenge of becoming Young Advocates,
where they are trained in the art of debate and persuasive speech. They
learn to stand up for causes they believe in, articulate their thoughts
clearly, and defend their viewpoints with confidence, respect, and conviction.</p>
<p><strong>📚 Developing the Love for Reading</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Books Alive!</strong>
</p>
<p>Reading is at the heart of language learning. Each year, our school celebrates
Books Alive!, a much-anticipated event that brings stories to life. Teachers
and students dress up as their favourite book characters, take part in
a prop-making competition, participate in quizzes, and attend inspiring
talks by local authors. The event fosters a vibrant reading culture and
builds a lifelong love for books.</p>

<p><strong>Literature (English) Appreciation Programme (LEAP) for P4 &amp; P5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>LEAP is where language comes alive — and where young minds take flight.</p>
<p>Through this specially crafted two-year journey, students are immersed
in popular and engaging literary texts that spark curiosity and encourage
deeper thinking. Held once a week, these lessons go beyond reading — they
invite students to explore themes, characters, and issues through lively
discussions and thoughtful analysis.</p>
<p>Using Paul’s Wheel of Reasoning, a powerful critical thinking tool, students
learn to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Make inferences and draw connections</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider different perspectives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluate arguments and ideas with clarity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This process sharpens their ability to think logically, speak confidently,
and write with purpose and precision.</p>
<p>By the end of the LEAP programme, our students don’t just grow in their
love for literature — they emerge as critical thinkers, empathetic listeners,
confident communicators, and proficient writers.</p>

<p><strong>Discover the Joy of Learning with E³ QUEST!</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(Engage. Explore. Excel.)</strong>
</p>
<p>At Pioneer Primary School, we believe that the early years are a critical
window for cultivating curiosity, creativity, and confidence. That’s why
our special curriculum for Primary 1 and Primary 2 students — E³ QUEST
— is designed to spark wonder, deepen understanding, and lay the foundation
for 21st-century competencies.</p>
<p>E³ QUEST stands for Engage, Explore, and Excel — the three pillars of
our dynamic learning approach. Through interdisciplinary, hands-on experiences,
students don’t just learn — they discover, imagine, create, and collaborate.</p>
<p>Each term, P1 and P2 students are engaged in a big learning experience
inspired by a selected STELLAR text, making literacy come alive through
immersive experiences. From making and testing kites to explore basic aerodynamics,
to planning a party for a surprise guest, students take part in exciting,
real-world tasks that develop problem-solving, teamwork, and communication
skills.</p>
