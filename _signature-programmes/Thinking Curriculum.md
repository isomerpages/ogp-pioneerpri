<h3><strong>Thinking Curriculum</strong></h3>
<p>The Thinking Curriculum @Pioneer Primary is developed to teach children
to think in a variety of ways.</p>
<h5>Our Approach</h5>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>It is about purposeful thinking within an active learning environment
that engages students in their learning and draws them into being responsible
for their own learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important for students to acquire reasoning skills and to inculcate
a disciplined way of thinking and problem solving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is ongoing reflection from self or group to learn from experiences
and explain decisions behind the thinking and actions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At its core, the Thinking Curriculum @ Pioneer Primary is designed to
develop the array of competencies in the MOE’s 21st Century Competencies
Framework- Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross-Cultural Skills;
Critical and Inventive Thinking; and Communication, Collaboration and Information
Skills through integrated lessons and distinctive learning experiences.
Closely aligned with the school vision, Passionate Learners, Confident
Learners, Gracious Citizens, the main goals of the programme are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>nurture our students to become confident and communicative learners through
the development of critical thinking skills,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>inculcate a spirit of inquiry and a passion for learning through authentic
learning experiences through the integrated lessons,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engage students to apply the elements of reasoning (See Figure 1) and
its intellectual standards to examine real-world issues and generate solutions,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use evidence and adopt different viewpoints to explain one’s reasoning
and decisions, having considered the implications of relationships among
different viewpoints,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promote critical thinking through varied platforms (e.g. ALP and LLP)
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>create opportunities to show empathy towards diverse groups and individuals
in school and the larger community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
