<h3><strong>Applied Learning Programme</strong></h3>
<p>Pioneer Primary believes in developing Deep Learning Competencies in students
to lay a solid foundation in our students for the VUCA world in the future.
In alignment to the school’s vision, the school conceptualises Advocacy
through Thinking, an Applied Learning Programme (ALP), to nurture Critical
and Innovative Thinkers, and Advocates with Empathy and Enterprising Spirit.</p>

<h4>Critical, Creative and Inventive Thinking</h4>
<p>Through the programme, our students build the competency to think critically
by learning Elements of Thought (EoT) defined by Paul’s Wheel of Reasoning.
With Elements of Thought, students generate ideas, and explore possibilities
in the Inter-Disciplinary learning of Environmental Literacy. The learning
experiences are founded on the Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle (Primary
1 to 3) and Design Thinking (Primary 4 to 6) pedagogical approaches. The
programme further strengthens the inculcation of Critical, Inventive and
Creative Thinking through Computational Thinking and Maker-Centred Learning.</p>
<h4>Effective Communication with Confidence</h4>
<p>In addition, the programme also nurtures students to be Confident and
Effective Communicators. Our students apply the Elements of Thought to
understand different points of view, and gain deep insights through asking
questions, interpreting information and making inferences. With greater
awareness of Purpose, Context and Audience, they communicate more effectively
and confidently to share ideas, convey opinions and rally support from
their peers.</p>

<h4>Stewardship and Advocacy</h4>
<p>The programme capitalises on Environmental Literacy as its central theme.
It is an approach that integrates Inquiry-based Learning, Experiential
Learning and Stewardship into a dynamic and cohesive pedagogical framework.
As good stewards of the environment, our students engage in environmental
inquiry to ask questions and explore issues about the environment. They
collaborate and advocate to the wider community their passion, beliefs
and solutions to environmental issues and problems, thus contributing and
making a positive impact to the community. The focus on advocacy is consistent
with MOE’s desired outcome to bring about active contributors as part of
active citizenry.</p>
