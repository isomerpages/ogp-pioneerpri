<h3><strong>Student Leadership Development</strong></h3>
<p>Our Student Leadership Development (SLD) Programme aims to equip Student
Leaders with the necessary leadership know-how and skills to lead self
and others in school projects, events and activities, serving the school
community and beyond. Through thoughtful and structured progression starting
from the lower primary years, we provide meaningful opportunities for students
to grow in character and leadership—laying a strong foundation for them
to thrive as responsible individuals and active contributors both in school
and beyond.</p>
<p>We are committed to nurturing leadership in all students by intentionally
embedding leadership skill-building opportunities into their everyday learning—through
Student Development Experiences and Character and Citizenship Education
lessons—empowering them to grow into confident, responsible, and values-driven
individuals.</p>
<h4>Our Leadership Model</h4>
<p>We look to The Leadership Challenge (TLC) Model by Jim Kouzes and Barry
Posner in planning school wide student leadership training. The model comprises
The Five Practices and Ten Commitments of Exemplary Leadership:</p>

<h4>Tiered System of Leadership Training and Development</h4>
<p>We adopt a tiered system of training and development to provide differentiated
leadership development for students, helping all to receive the baseline
training in leadership competencies and dispositions. Student leaders with
higher potential will undergo customised training programmes to maximise
their potential further.</p>

<h4>Student Leader Domain Groups</h4>
<p>Our Student Leadership structure is designed to align with students’ individual
interests and strengths by grouping them into specialised domains. These
domains — Wellbeing, Environment, Discipline, and Event Management — offer
student leaders targeted opportunities to develop and apply their leadership
skills in meaningful ways. This structure not only deepens their engagement
but also nurtures their growth as confident, responsible, and values-driven
leaders.</p>
<p><strong>The Wellbeing Domain</strong> focuses on nurturing the holistic
wellness of our school community by promoting physical health, mental well-being—including
cyber wellness—and fostering strong social connections.</p>
<p><strong>The Environment Domain</strong> is dedicated to creating a clean,
safe, and sustainable school environment by overseeing cleanliness, encouraging
green practices, and managing shared spaces like play areas.</p>
<p><strong>The Discipline Domain</strong> upholds a culture of respect and
responsibility by reinforcing positive behaviour, ensuring student safety,
and cultivating a supportive and orderly learning environment.</p>
<p><strong>The Event Management Domain</strong> plays a key role in planning
and executing school events, while equipping students with essential presentation
and communication skills to confidently support and lead various school
activities.</p>
