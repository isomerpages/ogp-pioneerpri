*“As the world becomes more complex and changes at a faster pace, we need to have many more leaders in every sphere and at every level. Leaders who have a clear purpose, who earn our trust and inspire us to continue our best to improve the lives of those around us. In that way, we can do more together as a team, than working alone.”
Mr Heng Swee Keat, Minster for Education
speech delivered at Character and Leadership Education Forum (28 May 2012)* </div></center>

<p align="Justify">Our Student Leadership Development (SLD) Programme aims to equip Pioneer Student Leaders with the necessary leadership know-how and skills to lead self and others in school projects and/or events/activities, serving the school community and beyond. With intentional planning, these opportunities form a critical pathway by which student leadership competencies are progressively developed, starting from the early years at lower primary level.</p>

<p align="Justify">In Pioneer Primary, we firmly believe that every student has the potential to be leaders. We emphasise the importance of providing all students with opportunities to learn and develop student leadership skills and competencies though Student Development Experiences and Character and Citizenship Education Lessons.  </p>

#### Tiered System of Leadership Training and Development
