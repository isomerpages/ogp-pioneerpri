<h3><strong>Internationalisation</strong></h3>
<p>In Pioneer, the school emphasizes holistic education, where children learn
beyond the classroom. We strive to provide our students with the best learning
experiences to help them reach their potential.</p>
<p>Every year, the school plans overseas trips for eligible upper primary
students. The students enjoy an immersive experience learning about the
history, culture and traditions of the host country. During the educational
trips to schools in the host country, they get to experience the school
system and build friendships with students in the school.</p>
<p>Through these overseas trips, we want to ensure that our students will
develop a higher sense of global awareness and commit his/her rootedness
in Singapore through the promotion of multi-lateral exchanges and mutual
understanding across cultures. These trips also allow our students to interact
effectively with their foreign counterparts and cultivate skills and values
such as self-reliance, independence and teamwork.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, our students have visited Hangzhou, Malacca,
Penang and Chiang Mai. Students have gained valuable experiences, skills
and knowledge from these trips.</p>
