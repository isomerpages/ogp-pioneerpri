<h3><strong>Student Well-Being</strong></h3>
<p>In Pioneer Primary School, ‘Students are our Gems’. We adopt the Self-Determination
Theory (Edward Deci and Richard Ryanto, 1985) as a broad framework in creating
purposeful experiences that promote positive psychological health and well-being
in students. Through the provision of a rich diversity of learning experiences,
students develop learning dispositions and social and emotional competencies
that will enable them to become self-directed and resilient individuals
who will lead self and others with confidence.</p>
<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<h4>Creating a Caring and Enabling Environment</h4>
<p>The cornerstone in our provision for student well-being is the creation
of a conducive learning environment that caters to students’ growth and
development in the physical, social, affective and cognitive domains. Leveraging
the environment as “third teacher”, we emphasise the significance of the
materials, space and mood of the classroom and overall school environment
that enable our students to feel safe, respected and accepted.</p>
<p>Key messages of the&nbsp;Growth Mindset&nbsp;by Professor Carol Dweck
are imbued in students through daily school experiences. We want them to
believe that intelligence can be developed through dedication, hard work,
collaboration and/or strategy. They are praised for their effort or strategy
used in tackling challenges, thereby linking&nbsp;effort with success.
Under the care and guidance of teachers, students learn to perceive challenges
and mistakes as&nbsp;opportunities to improve&nbsp;their learning and abilities,
leading to the development of a resilient mindset and passion for learning.</p>
<h4>Building Positive Relationships</h4>
<p><strong>Teacher-Student Relationships</strong>
</p>
<p>Positive relationships are the basis for effective learning to take place.
We invest time and effort to build quality teacher-student relationships
in and out of the classrooms. Through 1-1 CHATS and Form Teacher (FT) interaction
time with the students, teachers get to know the students better. Teachers
learn about their personalities, interests and strengths. With this knowledge,
teachers help students grow, while looking after their well-being and enhancing
their self-worth.</p>
<p><strong>Peer Support Relationships</strong>
</p>
<p>Other than teachers, it is key that students are equipped with relationship
management skills to effectively handle peer relationships. Such skills
are explicitly taught during FTGP lessons and further reinforced through
application during CCA training, House activities, Level Bonding Activities
and other student programmes. Students who possess essential traits and
leadership qualities are given opportunities to take up the role of Peer
Support Leaders.</p>
<h4>Our Key Programmes</h4>
<p><strong>Peer Support Leaders Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>A positive culture of care leads to positive outcomes in students. Hence,
through our Peer Support Leaders Programme, we hope to sustain a supportive
and caring culture for students, by students.</p>
<p>All classes have peer support leaders whose role is to help their friend
in school and motivate their friends to have a growth and resilient mindset.
FTGP and the Peer Support Leaders Programme provide platforms to enhance
peer support relations and promote a positive caring culture through explicit
teaching and peer bonding activities.</p>
<p>Our Peer Support Leaders are selected by their peers to be peer supporters.
These peer supporters will take on a more active role in looking out for
their peers and help their peers in seeking support.</p>
<p>With a strong social support network, students are surrounded by protective
factors. Peer Support Leaders will be alert to changes in their friends’
behaviour and recognize common signs of distress. They will then be able
to help their friends by referring them to a trusted adult in school such
as our teachers and school counsellors.</p>
<p><strong>GRIT+ Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of Tier 2 intervention support, GRIT+ Programme is designed to
equip students with social emotional learning competencies and motivation.
Students will undergo a 16-week intensive programme with a strong focus
on Social Emotional Skills and Environmental Education which are applicable
to the real-world context. The key objectives for this programme are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Create a safe and inclusive environment for students to share their challenges
through circle time facilitation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide tools and mentoring support for students to acquire the ability
of self-awareness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide students an opportunity to acquire relevant social &amp; soft
skills to build on their competencies level for self-management through
the planned activity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable students to see beyond self and develop empathy towards peers and
the community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ground students in values and take ownership of their responsible decision</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rewards &amp; Recognition Programme: Catch Me Doing Good (CMDG)</strong>
</p>
<p>Catch Me Doing Good (CMDG) is a school-wide Rewards and Recognition initiative
designed to foster a positive, inclusive school culture by acknowledging
students for their good conduct, achievements, and alignment with school
values. With a structured framework in place, CMDG celebrates students
who consistently show kindness, demonstrate excellence, and live out the
school's core principles.</p>
<p>At the heart of CMDG is a tiered rewards system that encourages both academic
success and positive behavior. As students earn CMDG stamps by meeting
teacher expectations, they can redeem these rewards in the dedicated CareXania
room—a dynamic space that not only motivates but also builds community.
The most outstanding students go on to receive the prestigious CMDG Star
Student Award.</p>
<p>CMDG follows the 3As Approach – Awareness, Application, and Affirmation.
This transformative strategy helps students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop awareness of positive behaviors and values,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply these values in everyday school life,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Receive affirmation and recognition for their efforts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Features of CMDG:</strong>
</p>
<p>1. Holistic and Structured Recognition</p>
<p>CMDG goes beyond traditional reward systems by recognizing both academic
excellence and positive character development. It promotes ongoing growth,
perseverance, and integrity, nurturing a supportive and values-driven school
environment.</p>
<p>2. Tiered Reward System with a Purpose</p>
<p>Through a clear and motivating structure, students are encouraged to set
goals and strive for continuous improvement. The system is used across
IP and non-IP departments, offering consistent encouragement for both academic
and personal development.</p>
<p>3. Fostering Friendship and Teamwork in CareXania</p>
<p>CareXania is more than just a rewards room. It’s a space where students
come together to bond through games and collaborative activities. These
experiences build camaraderie, sportsmanship, and a sense of belonging,
enriching students’ social skills and creating lasting positive memories.</p>
