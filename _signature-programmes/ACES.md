<h3>ACES (Agency, Competency, Excellence, Students@PPS)</h3>
<p>The ACES framework empowers students to act effectively in a VUCA world
by integrating student agency with 21st Century Competencies (21CC). It
helps students cultivate adaptive and inventive thinking, improve communication
and collaboration skills, and develop civic literacy—while taking ownership
of their learning journey.</p>
<p>Grounded in Self-Determination Theory (SDT), the framework uses the 3As—Awareness,
Application, and Affirmation—to guide student development and promote student
engagement. It stresses Competence and Autonomy to nurture agency, while
fostering Relatedness through a caring environment. The adapted Leadership
Challenge Model offers a shared language and set of practices to support
the growth of agency, socio-emotional skills, and 21CC.</p>
<p>ACES includes several experiential and exploratory components designed
to achieve these outcomes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Life Skills Lessons</strong>: As students transition from preschool
to primary school, they embark on a purposeful journey to develop essential
life skills that continue to advance throughout their six years at Pioneer
Primary. In addition to CCE FTGP and Mother Tongue lessons, life skills
are explicitly taught to strengthen students’ social-emotional competencies.
Within a values-driven and nurturing environment, students are afforded
structured opportunities to apply their learning, fostering self-awareness,
empathy and responsible decision-making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Passion Time</strong>: Our Modular Enrichment Programmes for lower
primary are designed to ignite curiosity, develop students’ strengths and
foster a love for lifelong learning. It is aligned with students’ interests
and developmental stages, encouraging exploration and growth through diverse
modules offered across four terms. Students apply life skills and Emerging
21st Century Competencies (E21CC) in real-world contexts. This foundation
supports students as they make informed choices for their Co-Curricular
Activities (CCAs) when they enter Primary 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Programme for Active Learning (PAL)</strong>: Primary 1 and 2
students experience hands-on learning through the Programme for Active
Learning (PAL), which includes Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Visual
Arts and Performing Arts. PAL nurtures curiosity, confidence and cooperation,
while helping students build friendships and develop social-emotional skills.
It also offers meaningful opportunities for teachers and students to bond
through reflection and discussions on self-awareness and relationships. <strong>Read more about PAL</strong> LINK

<li>
<p><strong>Genius Hour</strong>: Genius Hour introduces lower primary students
to computational and logical thinking through fun, age-appropriate activities
like games and unplugged tasks. They build important skills such as pattern
recognition, algorithmic thinking and problem-solving. These experiences
prepare them for more advanced learning in Primary 3 to 6, where they continue
to explore coding and creativity through curriculum activities and recess
play at the Makerspace. This helps students grow confident in using technology
in everyday life.</p>
