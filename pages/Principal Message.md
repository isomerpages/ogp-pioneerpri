<p align="justify">Our school vision is to groom our students to be Passionate Learners, Confident Leaders and Gracious Citizens. Indeed, Pioneer Primary School has been true in our mission to create a vibrant learning environment, setting our students on a path of discovery and growth. The school’s programmes and activities are geared towards ensuring that students are developed holistically and equipped with 21st Century Competencies.</p>

<p align="justify">To pique students’ curiosity and to stretch their creative and critical thinking, we have thoughtfully designed many interesting platforms to stimulate and nurture students’ imagination and intellectual curiosity. For example, in the Applied Learning Programme (ALP – Design Thinking), the students collaborated and immersed themselves in rich discussions on the issues and challenges of a given problem. They worked together to interview the stakeholders (students and staff) to define the problem and brainstorm for solutions. They went on a learning journey to broaden their perspectives before creating and testing their prototypes. </p>

<p align="justify">This year, recess at Pioneer Primary School has never been the same again! We leveraged different spaces in school to create unique learning experiences for students to play, innovate and learn during recess. Thanks to the teachers, a repertoire of rich and holistic learning experiences await them. Students are spoilt for choice on how they want to spend their recess time! They can explore and learn coding at Makerspace, enrich their Science concepts at the I-Xperia, play a sport or learn to play an instrument at the Music Haven! Through the different programmes and platforms, we hope to develop in our students the spirit of curiosity and an appetite to learn more and discover their talents and passions, and to excel in their pursuits. </p>

<p align="justify">Our School Motto, “Go for Excellence” admonishes us to put our best effort into all endeavours and seek continuous improvement. In the words of Aristotle, “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence therefore is not an act but a habit.” Excellence is not a one-hit wonder. It takes continuous effort, hard work and dedication to always strive for the best! Hence, Pioneer students will do well to remember to pursue learning with curiosity and passion, ask questions to deepen learning and think critically and creatively to solve problems. Be a Confident Leader. Take initiative to learn new things. Embrace challenges as opportunities for growth and learning. Do not be afraid to step out of the comfort zone as the teachers are always there to lead and guide.</p>

<p align="justify">Do you know what a bumblebee looks like? The bumblebee has a heavy body and tiny wings. Have you ever wondered how their tiny wings support their heavy bodies? According to the scientists, their wings beat at a high frequency and generate a lift through a figure-eight motion, allowing them to hover and fly efficiently. The bumblebees do not impose limitations on themselves because they are not aware that their heavy body may inhibit flying, and they keep flying. So, the learning point here is not to limit yourself and think that you can’t do it! The only limitations a person has are those that are self-imposed. Have a growth mindset and say, “<b>I Can Do It</b>”! To all Pioneer students, we believe you are capable of achieving incredible things and l would like to encourage you to persevere and work at it! So, go ahead, take the first step and believe that <b>You Can Do It!</b></p>

<p>I wish all students and staff a fulfilling year ahead, making every effort to 
	<b>Go for Excellence</b>!
