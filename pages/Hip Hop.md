# Hip Hop
This CCA nurtures students' interest and talent in street dance. Students are equipped with the fundamental skills and techniques of this dance form, and are given opportunities to showcase their learning to the school and the community. Some memorable moments include performing at the SYF Celebrations TRANSCENDance at the Esplanade Outdoor Theatre and clinching first place at the Super 24 Dance Competition. Through dance, Hip Hop aims to nurture students to be all-rounded individuals by instilling in them values of harmony, teamwork and perseverance, as well as acquiring essential life skills to become active, healthy and confident children.
