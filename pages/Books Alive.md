### Books Alive

<td style="text-align: center; width: 60%; border:0;"><p align="justify">To kickstart Books Alive!, our teachers actively engaged their students in a diverse range of enthralling activities to cultivate a love for reading. These included thought-provoking mini book discussions in the EL classroom and crafting props of their beloved book characters. The students' ingenious creations were proudly displayed at the Props Museum in the school library, where they added a vibrant splash of colour and creativity.</p></td>
