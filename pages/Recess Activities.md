### **Recess Activities**

#### Music

<table><tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center; width: 60%; border:0;"><p align="justify">Music activities during recess play provide our students with the platform to unwind, relax and engage with their favourite musical instruments, such as the Ukulele or Cajon. They also get to sing along with their peers during their break time. </p>
	
<p align="justify">Students who like to practise what they have learnt during their music lessons can also take the opportunity to hone their skills. Student leaders were also trained to manage the loaning of instruments and the recess play sessions.  Students were engaged and had fun. They were also more confident when they performed with their peers in front of a small audience.</p>

#### Science
<table><tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center; width: 60%; border:0;"><p align="justify">As part of the Science Outreach Programme, students are given the opportunity to visit the Science Activity Room (i-Xperia), where they get to participate in various hands-on activities and experiments such as colour chromatography and water filtration listed in the Young Scientist Card. At i-Xperia, students get to engage in self-directed learning and develop their initiative and creativity.</p>
	
<p align="justify">In Semester 1, students made balloon-powered toy cars using recycled materials such as plastic drink bottles and bottle caps. They learnt how to make their toy car move with air from an inflated balloon. Students also had the chance to create a working model of the human hand using common art materials.</p>

#### Maker Space
<table><tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center; width: 60%; border:0;"><p align="justify">Maker Space is a new initiative that offers students a unique opportunity to engage in purposeful play and learning during recess. Equipped with a diverse array of maker kits, students are encouraged to explore, experiment, and express their creativity to the fullest.</p>
	
<p align="justify">In Term 1, our enthusiastic students embarked on an exhilarating journey with Ozobots, where they developed fundamental computational skills and mastered complex coding logics as they navigated through challenging obstacles and completed scavenger hunts.</p>
	
<p align="justify">The self-directed and structured-play format not only enhanced their cognitive abilities but also fostered a strong sense of teamwork and camaraderie, preparing them to become future leaders and innovators.</p>

#### Sports/Games
<table><tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center; width: 60%; border:0;"><p align="justify">To promote healthy activities and play during their break time, our school implemented recess play for Sports and Games. At the beginning of the term, PE representatives from each class underwent training to become effective student leaders. They learnt how to set up the play areas and manage the PE equipment for their peers during recess play.</p>
	
<p align="justify">Students were thrilled to play badminton, frisbee, and other sports with their friends, keeping themselves active and engaged during break time. The recess play activity has provided a meaningful and fun platform for our students to interact with each other while also promoting physical activity and healthy play.</p>
