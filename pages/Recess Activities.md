### **Recess Activities**

#### Music

<table><tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center; width: 60%; border:0;"><p align="justify">Music activities during recess play provide our students with the platform to unwind, relax and engage with their favourite musical instruments, such as the Ukulele or Cajon. They also get to sing along with their peers during their break time. </p>
	
<p align="justify">Students who like to practise what they have learnt during their music lessons can also take the opportunity to hone their skills. Student leaders were also trained to manage the loaning of instruments and the recess play sessions.  Students were engaged and had fun. They were also more confident when they performed with their peers in front of a small audience.</p>
