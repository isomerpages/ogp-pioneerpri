# Art Expression Club
<p align="Justify">Art Expression Club aims to cultivate a love and appreciation for the visual arts in each of our member. Through the weekly session of hands-on activities, we hope to develop positive values and art skills in these young learners. Like what Picasso says, “Every child is an artist”, we hope to inspire them and encourage them to express themselves creatively through different forms of art.</p>
