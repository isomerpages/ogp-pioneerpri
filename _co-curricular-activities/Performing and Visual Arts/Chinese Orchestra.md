# Chinese Orchestra
<p align="Justify">“Every child can be a musician”. Pioneer Primary School is one of the few schools in the West that offers Chinese Orchestra. We believe that music has no language barrier.  Our Chinese Orchestra takes part in school-based performances to allow our students to build their confidence and gain stage experience. Our students also learn values such as perseverance, responsibility and teamwork.</p>
