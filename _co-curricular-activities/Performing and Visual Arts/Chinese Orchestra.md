<h3><strong>Chinese Orchestra</strong></h3>
<p><strong>"Every child can be a musician."</strong>
<br>At Pioneer Primary School, we believe that music transcends language,
and every child should have the opportunity to explore its beauty. We provide
our students with a unique platform to learn traditional Chinese instruments
and appreciate the rich heritage behind the music.</p>
<p>Through various school-based performances and events, our Chinese Orchestra
members gain valuable stage experience and build confidence in expressing
themselves through music. Along the way, they also develop important values
such as perseverance, responsibility, and teamworkâ€”skills that extend far
beyond the music room.</p>
