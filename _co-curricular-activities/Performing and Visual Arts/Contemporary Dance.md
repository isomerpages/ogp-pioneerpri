# Contemporary Dance
Other than honing their dance skills, the Contemporary Dance CCA also places utmost importance on character building. Through the dance practices, students are taught the value of discipline, focus and determination. Students are given opportunities to be expressive and they gain confidence in themselves. Our teachers constantly plan team-building activities for students to learn how to work as part of a team, develop a greater sense of trust and cooperation and of course, to make new friends!
