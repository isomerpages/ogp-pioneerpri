<h1>International Dance</h1>
<p>The International Dance CCA is more than just dance—it’s a journey of
growth and self-discovery. Our students refine their techniques while building
essential values such as discipline, focus, and perseverance. Through dynamic
training sessions and team-building activities, they develop confidence,
teamwork, and lasting friendships. Join us and experience the joy of dance
while growing as a performer and an individual!</p>
