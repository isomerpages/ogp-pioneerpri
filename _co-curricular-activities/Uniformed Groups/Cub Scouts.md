<h3><strong>Cub Scouts</strong></h3>
<p>The Cub Scouts is a uniformed group CCA where every child can learn diverse
new skills, stay active, and build self-confidence by taking on various
challenges. Through hands-on activities, they develop important life skills
while having a great time with friends. Cubs take part in special events
at the Area and HQ levels, as well as learning journeys that expand their
knowledge and abilities. They also work towards earning badges in areas
like camping, outdoor adventures, citizenship, and helping the community.
Itâ€™s a great way for children to grow, explore, and discover their potential!</p>
