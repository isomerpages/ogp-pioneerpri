# Cub Scouts
Cub Scouts programme aims to provide a group environment which is intellectually stimulating, physically vital and directed towards satisfying the child’s need to face and overcome challenges. Self-developmental activities are well entrenched components of the overall drive towards encouraging “Fun & Discovery” among the Cubs.  Members actively participate in district and HQ events, with learning journeys organised to gain knowledge and skills.  Cub Scouts aim to earn a series of badges which give them knowledge of basic scouting skills and mark achievements in areas such as camp craft, air and water activities, citizenship, environment improvement and community-involvement activities.
