<h1>Netball</h1>
<p>Welcome to&nbsp;<strong>PPS Netball</strong>, where students develop athletic
skills, strong character, and meaningful connections. Through structured
training sessions and competitive matches, our players cultivate&nbsp;<strong>resilience, responsibility, teamwork, discipline, and perseverance</strong>—qualities
that prepare them for success both on and off the court.</p>
<p>Guided by our motto,&nbsp;<strong>“Persevere and Soar,”</strong>&nbsp;we
emphasize the importance of dedication, growth, and camaraderie. Netball
provides a dynamic platform for students to embrace challenges, learn from
setbacks, and celebrate collective achievements.&nbsp;Our CCA fosters a
supportive environment where every player is encouraged to push their limits
while working cohesively as a team.</p>

<p><strong>Perseverance:</strong>&nbsp;Striving for continuous improvement.</p>

as athletes but as confident, compassionate, and united individuals. Join
us in shaping resilient leaders and lasting memories—both in sport and
in life.</p>
<p><strong>"Persevere and Soar—because true victory lies not just in winning games, but in building unshakable character, lifelong bonds, and the courage to keep soaring.</strong>
