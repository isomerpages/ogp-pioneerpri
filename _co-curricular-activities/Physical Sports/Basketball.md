<h3><strong>Basketball</strong></h3>
<p>Basketball CCA trains the boys in the basic skills and concepts of territorial
game through various age appropriate and authentic drills and activities.
We aim to develop students not just in their basketball skills and knowledge,
but also in the form of personal growth and character development. We focuses
on nurturing well-rounded student-athletes who excel both on and off the
court.</p>
<p>The training sessions provide players to master fundamental basketball
skills and concepts, including dribbling, shooting, passing, and defensive
techniques. Our structured basketball drills are designed to challenge
players at every level, from beginners to advanced athletes. There is high
emphasis of teamwork as players learn to communicate effectively and support
one another during both training and competitions.</p>
<p>Through victories and setbacks, our athletes develop resilience, learning
to bounce back stronger from challenges and maintain a positive mindset.
These values extend beyond the basketball court, shaping our students into
exemplary individuals in their academic and personal lives.</p>
