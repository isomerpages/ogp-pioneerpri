<h1>Football</h1>
<p>We aim to develop the love for football in our young players and cultivate
a passion for the sport. Through the skills acquisition and endurance training,
we hope to build resilience and tenacity in our players.&nbsp; Group play
provide opportunities for team building and respect for one another. We
aim to develop them into responsible leaders of the future.</p>
<p>In 2025, our Senior Football Team, managed to top our group during the
Tiered Round and booked a ticket to the top four of League 4 finals. We
managed to clinch the third spot through the grit and determination, resilience
and ‘never give-up’ attitude of our players.</p>
<p>Congratulations Seniors!</p>
