<h1>Wushu</h1>
<p>In Pioneer Primary School, Wushu is more than just a martial art—it is
a journey of discipline, resilience, and teamwork. Through sustained participation,
students progressively develop essential Wushu techniques, enhancing their
strength, agility, and coordination. Beyond physical skills, Wushu instills
important values such as perseverance, respect, and self-discipline.</p>
<p>As students train together, they build strong friendships and develop
social-emotional competencies, learning to support and encourage one another.
The shared experiences create a sense of belonging and identity within
the school community. Wushu also provides a platform for students from
diverse backgrounds to interact, fostering mutual understanding and social
integration.</p>
<p>Through this CCA, students embody core values while acquiring 21st-century
competencies such as confidence, adaptability, and teamwork—equipping them
with skills that extend beyond the training ground and into their daily
lives.</p>
