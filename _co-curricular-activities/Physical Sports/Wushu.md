# Wushu
<p align="Justify">Wushu is a Chinese word, 武术 , which is a combination of the characters wǔ, which means “martial“ or “combat”, and shù, which means “art form“.  Wu Shu literally means “martial arts“. Wu Shu is both an exhibition and a full-contact sport derived from traditional Chinese martial arts. Our programme is geared towards nurturing students to appreciate the art as they strengthen their bodies.</p>
