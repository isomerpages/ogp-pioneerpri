<h3><strong>Our Co–Curricular Activities</strong></h3>
<p>Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) play a vital role in nurturing well-rounded
individuals, providing students with meaningful opportunities to explore
their interests, uncover their talents and develop lifelong passions. Our
CCA programme, seamlessly integrated into curriculum time with additional
training sessions for selected students, is designed to ignite a lasting
love for activities such as sports and the arts—ultimately encouraging
students to pursue their interests and achieve a holistic education.</p>
<p>We offer a diverse range of CCAs across Physical Sports, Performing and
Visual Arts, Uniformed Groups and Clubs. Each CCA is thoughtfully designed
to build character and essential life skills. Physical Sports cultivate
resilience, teamwork and sportsmanship, whilst the Performing and Visual
Arts foster creativity and deepen appreciation for our rich multicultural
heritage. Uniformed Groups develop discipline, responsibility and a spirit
of service, and our Clubs encourage both exploration and mastery in specialised
areas whilst enhancing students' information, communication and technical
capabilities.</p>
<p>Consistent participation in CCAs enables students to progressively develop
activity-specific skills, values and attitudes, whilst nurturing social
and emotional competencies and essential 21st Century skills such as creativity,
critical thinking, collaboration and leadership. Beyond skill development,
CCAs serve as a powerful platform for social interaction, creating inclusive
spaces where friendships flourish and students from diverse backgrounds
unite in shared purpose. Through these experiences, students develop a
stronger sense of identity, belonging and pride in their school community.</p>
