**Verse 1** 

In Pioneer, we give our best
Soaring to greater heights
Where our dreams come true
In Pioneer, we learn and grow
Friendships are forged to last
Let our hearts unite as one

With pride we stand tall
With love we grow strong
We’ll ride the waves
And rise up in victory

**Chorus (2x)**

Come sing with me as one
With passion and confidence
With honor and respect
Our flag flies high

**Verse 2**

In Pioneer, we give our best,
Soaring to greater heights,
Where our dreams come true.
In Pioneer, we learn and grow,
Friendships are forged to last,
Let our hearts unite as one.

With pride we stand tall
With love we grow strong
We’ll ride the waves
And rise up in victory

**Bridge**

Steadfast and press on we will achieve
Embrace our challenges with a brave heart.
