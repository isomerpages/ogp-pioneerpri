**Verse 1** 

In Pioneer, we give our best<br>
Soaring to greater heights<br>
Where our dreams come true<br>
In Pioneer, we learn and grow<br>
Friendships are forged to last<br>
Let our hearts unite as one<br>

With pride we stand tall<br>
With love we grow strong<br>
We’ll ride the waves<br>
And rise up in victory<br>

**Chorus (2x)**

Come sing with me as one<br>
With passion and confidence<br>
With honor and respect<br>
Our flag flies high<br>

**Verse 2**

In Pioneer, we give our best,<br>
Soaring to greater heights,<br>
Where our dreams come true.<br>
In Pioneer, we learn and grow,<br>
Friendships are forged to last,<br>
Let our hearts unite as one.<br>

With pride we stand tall<br>
With love we grow strong<br>
We’ll ride the waves<br>
And rise up in victory<br>

**Bridge**

Steadfast and press on we will achieve<br>
Embrace our challenges with a brave heart.<br>
