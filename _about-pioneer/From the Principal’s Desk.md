Welcome to Pioneer Primary School! 
My warmest greetings and best wishes to everyone for a wonderful and fulfilling new year!
 
The merger of Juying Primary School and Pioneer Primary School has presented us with many possible opportunities to create an exciting future ahead of us.  Building on the strengths of both schools and together with the full commitment of all staff, we are determined to embark on this exciting journey to bring Pioneer Primary School to greater heights.

Our school vision, **“Passionate Learners, Confident Leaders, Gracious Citizens”**, encapsulates the overall direction and purpose of Pioneer Primary School.  As a new school, we aspire to offer a student-centric, values-driven education for our students. We design and deliver a holistic education that seeks to develop our students to be self-directed individuals who find great joy in learning, ground them in the foundational knowledge and with a strong emphasis on critical thinking, character building and leadership. 

To prepare our students for a fast-changing VUCA world, our focus is forward-looking with a dynamic curriculum that equips our young charges with skills needed for the 21st Century. With a vibrant learning environment, innovative teaching and learning pedagogies and a team of professional staff to support students in their foundation years, Pioneer students will grow to be critical thinkers and confident persons. These aspirations are made possible in a nurturing environment where a strong culture of **Care and Excellence** is emphasised at every touchpoint.

**Excellence** is a journey and an iterative process of exploring, learning, innovating and seeking continuous improvement. In our journey to excellence, we show Care and respect for everyone, supporting and helping one another to adapt and settle into the new culture.  In Pioneer, we believe that every student is capable of soaring high in pursuit of their dreams and aspirations.  Like a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly through the process of metamorphosis, every Pioneer student will go through the journey of growth at their own pace.  Dedicated teachers and staff will play an important role to nurture and inspire, instil hope and confidence in students to enable them to strive for their glorious future and let their dreams take flight.

Our shared beliefs will act as our compass and together as a school, we are committed to the quest to spearhead innovation and lead change so that Pioneer students will grow to become confident leaders who make active contributions to the community.

Indeed, there is much to rejoice as we continue to work with our students in their foundation years. Amidst the changes and renewals, we have every reason to look ahead confidently, and be excited about what the future holds for Pioneer! Together with the strong support of our stakeholders, we’ll embark on our journey of excellence with a shared mission towards a shared goal, driven by our shared aspirations.

Have an amazing 2022 everyone!
 
Mrs Lee Wai Ling
