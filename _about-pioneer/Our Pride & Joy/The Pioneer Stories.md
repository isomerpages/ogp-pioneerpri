The digital Flipbook “Cherishing the Past, Celebrating the Present, Creating the Future” is a project by Juying Primary School to capture the significant milestones and achievements of the school from 1995 to 2021 before the merger with Pioneer Primary School. It features many innovative programmes and projects over the years under the leadership of the 4 inspiring Principals and team of dedicated teachers and support staff.

## March to a Whole New World, 25 November 2021

In an event to celebrate the merger, we marked the occasion with a March to A Whole New World culminating in a mass dance to a Glorious Future! The event carries a very significant meaning where both schools’ staff and students are marching towards a Whole New World and include the unveiling of “The Sail” which is done by both schools’ staff and students. “The Sail” signifies the unyielding spirit and commitment of all staff and students to ride the waves and set sail on an exciting journey towards a Glorious Future.
