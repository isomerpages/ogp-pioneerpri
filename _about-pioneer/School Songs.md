<h4>Glorious Future</h4>
<p>“Behind the song is the heartbeat of every educator who is called to lead,
care and inspire. The lyrics express the loving and caring relationship
between teachers and students and the hope of seeing our students work
hard, preparing to ride the rainbow towards a glorious future.”</p>
<p>Lyrics By Mr Charles Tan

<h4>The Phoenix Rises</h4>
<p>Pioneer Primary School has specially prepared a song and MTV “The Phoenix
Rises” to celebrate our impending move to the Tengah District in 2026.</p>
<p>Using the metaphor of a phoenix, the song tells of the glorious re-making
of Pioneer Primary School in the Tengah Estate. The song is also dedicated
to the teaching fraternity who are committed to “lead, care and inspire”.</p>
<p>For the noble work that teachers do daily, they have every reason to “lift
their heads high, beaming with pride”!</p>

<h4>Peanut Butter and Jelly</h4>
<p>We would like to share with you a song written by our very own P6 students.
It is about their journey in PPS and how they have not only acquired knowledge
and facts but also developed strong friendships. They described their friendships
like peanut butter and jelly and how they would stick together like honey.
This is part of our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) and the students
have demonstrated their creative talents in the production of this song.</p>
