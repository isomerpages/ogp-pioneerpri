**Verse 1**

Hold my hand and walk<br>
Whisper a way to me<br>
Help me grow my wings<br>
And watch me soar<br>
Let me brave the tides and waters<br>
Let me cross the deepest oceans<br>
So that I can sing with pride<br>
I have made it through the years<br>

**Pre-chorus**

Let us sing this song with gladness<br>
Thanks to all who believed in me<br>
I remember all the good times<br>
Always cherished in my heart<br>

**Chorus**

Thanks to your love and it means to me<br>
Thanks for your words they inspire me<br>
Color the sky and paint the clouds<br>
Trace the rainbows to my dreams<br>
Thanks to your care I can feel its warmth<br>
Thanks for the hope you have given me<br>
Glorious future here I come<br>
Watch me let my dreams take flight<br>

**Verse 2**

Hold my hand and walk<br>
Whisper a way to me<br>
Let me spread my wings<br>
Ready to soar<br>
Let me brave the tides and waters<br>
Let me cross the deepest oceans<br>
So that I can sing with pride<br>
I have made it through the years<br>

**Pre-chorus**

Let us sing this song with gladness<br>
Thanks to all who guided me<br>
I remember all my good friends<br>
Always hidden in my heart<br>

**Chorus**

Thanks to your love and it means to me<br>
Thanks for your words they inspire me<br>
Color the sky and paint the clouds<br>
Trace the rainbows to my dreams<br>
Thanks to your care I can feel its warmth<br>
Thanks for the hope you have given me<br>
Glorious future here I come<br>
Watch me let my dreams take flight<br>
