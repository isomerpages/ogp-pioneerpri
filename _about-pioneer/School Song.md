**Verse 1**

Hold my hand and walk
Whisper a way to me
Help me grow my wings
And watch me soar
Let me brave the tides and waters
Let me cross the deepest oceans
So that I can sing with pride
I have made it through the years

**Pre-chorus**

Let us sing this song with gladness
Thanks to all who believed in me
I remember all the good times
Always cherished in my heart

**Chorus**

Thanks to your love and it means to me
Thanks for your words they inspire me
Color the sky and paint the clouds
Trace the rainbows to my dreams
Thanks to your care I can feel its warmth
Thanks for the hope you have given me
Glorious future here I come
Watch me let my dreams take flight

**Verse 2**

Hold my hand and walk
Whisper a way to me
Let me spread my wings
Ready to soar
Let me brave the tides and waters
Let me cross the deepest oceans
So that I can sing with pride
I have made it through the years

**Pre-chorus**

Let us sing this song with gladness
Thanks to all who guided me
I remember all my good friends
Always hidden in my heart

**Chorus**

Thanks to your love and it means to me
Thanks for your words they inspire me
Color the sky and paint the clouds
Trace the rainbows to my dreams
Thanks to your care I can feel its warmth
Thanks for the hope you have given me
Glorious future here I come
Watch me let my dreams take flight
