<h2>Holistic Curriculum with a distinctive Singapore Flavour</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Welcome to MOE Kindergartens (MKs)!</p>
<p>At MKs, we are dedicated to providing your child with a strong start!</p>
<p>Our curriculum is based on the beliefs and principles in the Nurturing
Early Learners (NEL) Framework, that children are joyful, curious, active,
and competent learners. We emphasize on children’s holistic development
through an integrated approach to learning with teachers engaging children
in learning through quality interaction and purposeful play.</p>
<p>Our Focus:</p>
<p>• The MK curriculum aims to children holistically, so that they are confident,
demonstrate strong social skills, and have a good foundation in literacy
and numeracy.</p>
<p>• The MK curriculum is designed by MOE curriculum specialists and educators
with knowledge and experience in early childhood education and primary
school curriculum. It emphasizes holistic development of the children</p>
<p>• Through an integrated approach to teaching and learning.</p>
<p>• Early Childhood Bilingualism: Nurturing early childhood bilingualism
is an important aspect of our curriculum. We seek to nurture early childhood
bilingualism through systematic and explicit teaching of language and early
literacy skills. Children are provided with opportunities to enjoy English
and their Mother Tongue Language (Chinese, Malay or Tamil), communicate
with confidence and be aware of local transitions and customs.</p>
<p>Flagship Programmes:</p>
<p>•HI-Light Programme: Holistically develops your child through an integrated
approach to teaching and learning.</p>
<p>• Starlight Literacy Programme: Enhances language skills through o</p>
<p>engaging stories, songs, rhymes, and games in a local context.</p>
<p>• Weeks of Wonder Projects: Children work together on projects that interest
them, promoting teamwork and curiosity.</p>
<p>Centre-based programmes:</p>
<p>&lt;MKs may add on information about their own centre-based programmes.&gt;</p>
<p>Enriching Experiences:</p>
<p>Field Trips: We organise occasional field trips to places of interest
so that your child can better understand the people and places in Singapore
and the world they live in.</p>
