<h2>Seamless Transition from MK to Primary One</h2>
<p></p>
<p>â€œWhy Choose MKs?</p>
<p>MK Curriculum:</p>
<p>Through the intentional design of the MK curriculum, our MK children are
guided in developing essential skills and attitudes towards learning needed
for a smooth transition to primary school and lifelong learning.</p>
<p>Familiarity with primary school environment:</p>
<p>Our MK children are familiar with the primary school environment, helping
them better navigate and adapt to the larger school environment as they
move on to Primary 1.</p>
<p>Enriched Learning Experiences:</p>
<p>Being part of a primary school allows our MK children to participate in
joint programmes and events like cultural celebrations and sports days,
offering opportunities for them to interact with and learn from primary
school students and teachers. These enrich their learning and social development.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Close Collaboration with Primary School:</p>
<p>We maintain close partnerships with our primary school educators to ensure
continuity and progression in curriculum and teaching methods, promoting
a coherent and continuous educational experience.</p>
<p>Supportive MK Environment:</p>
<p>Located within a primary school, MK@XX offers a seamless and supportive
transition for children moving from preschool to primary school.</p>
<p>At MK@PPS, we are committed to making your child's early education journey
smooth and enriching, setting a strong foundation for their future success
in learning. Join us and give your child the strong start in their educational
journey!</p>
