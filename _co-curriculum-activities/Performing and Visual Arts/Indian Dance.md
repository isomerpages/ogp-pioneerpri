It also helps to stretch the potential of every student, increasing one’s determination, perseverance and resilience beyond the CCA. The focus of the weekly training sessions aims to provide students with the basic dance moves and hand movements. Through various performances, the passionate dancers learn to work together, stay resilient and do the best as a team.
