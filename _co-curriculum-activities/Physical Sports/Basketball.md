# Basketball

Basketball CCA trains the boys in the basic skills and concepts of territorial game through various age appropriate and authentic drills and activities. We aim to develop students not just in their basketball skills and knowledge, but also in character and values acquisition. Through experiential learning, we aim to inculcate values such as resilience, teamwork and care during training sessions and competitive game play.  Students are given opportunities to compete in competitions and gain valuable experiences in applying hard and soft skills accquired during the trainings.
