# Counselling Services
Pioneer Counselling Programme provides support for our students to ensure overall personal and social well-being. Our school counsellors work closely with students who struggle with emotional and well-being difficulties. They establish a therapeutic relationship with the students through trust and empathy. They help students learn and apply strategies to manage and cope with their emotions and make choices for positive change and development.

#### Desired Outcomes

Students will be able to:

* Develop healthy identities
* Recognise and manage their own emotions
* Develop a sense of responsibility, care and concern for others
* Relate to others and develop positive relationships
