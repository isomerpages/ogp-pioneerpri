#### Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS)

The Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) is a student-centric learning portal by the Ministry of Education (MOE). The learning portal enhances existing teaching and learning in schools and at home through the use of technology. Students will be able to learn anytime, anywhere, and at their own pace, whether independently or with their peers.

To access the portal, each student uses a unique username - made up of the first five characters of the student’s name and last five characters of his/her BC Number.

For example:

Name: Mary Tan

BC number: T1234567A

SLS Username: MARYT4567A

#### Parents Gateway (PG)

Parents Gateway (PG) is a one-stop mobile application by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to connect parents and schools on key administrative matters.

The application allows schools to send updates on programmes and activities, and also allows for parents to perform administrative functions such as providing consent for their children to participate in school activities. With improved communications, parents and schools will be able to provide better support for students in their educational journey.

Parents can use their SingPass accounts, SMS 2FA or OneKey Token1 to gain access to Parents Gateway.
